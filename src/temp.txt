Run a detailed audit of the current status of the code base. Diff this against the EDD and Supporting Diagrams you just read. Present to me a detailed report of what is implemented, what needs to be done, and what could be done better.

RESPONSE

I'll conduct a detailed audit by examining the actual codebase and comparing it against the Engineering Design Document (EDD) and supporting diagrams. Let me gather the necessary context from key files.

Based on my analysis of the codebase against the Engineering Design Document (EDD) and supporting diagrams, I'll provide a detailed audit report:

IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS:

Core Interfaces & Architecture:
✓ Hexagonal architecture implemented with clear separation via interfaces
✓ All major interfaces defined as specified in EDD (BlockchainClient, BankAccountClient, FireflyClient, DatabaseClient)
✓ Factory pattern implemented for client creation
Blockchain Support:
✓ Ethereum client with Etherscan API integration
✓ Solana client with Solscan API integration
✓ SUI client with JSON-RPC API integration
✓ Common transaction model implementation
Banking Integration:
✓ Enable Banking client implementation
✓ Support for multiple currencies
✓ Balance and transaction fetching
Firefly III Integration:
✓ Auto-generated API client from OpenAPI spec
✓ Custom transaction mapping layer
✓ Account management functionality
PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:

Database Layer:
△ Basic SQLite interface defined
△ Transaction tracking functionality present
Missing: Full implementation of embedding-based similar transaction search
Service Layer:
△ Basic service manager structure
△ Transaction service framework
Missing: Complete error handling and retry logic
Missing: Comprehensive transaction processing pipeline
Configuration:
△ Basic config structure implemented
Missing: Complete validation logic
Missing: Dynamic reload capability
NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION:

Background Processing:
✗ Periodic execution system
✗ Graceful shutdown handling
✗ Progress tracking and resumption
Error Handling:
✗ Comprehensive retry strategies
✗ Rate limiting implementation
✗ Error reporting and monitoring
Data Management:
✗ Transaction deduplication logic
✗ Balance reconciliation system
✗ Historical data management
Security:
✗ Credential encryption at rest
✗ Token rotation for banking APIs
✗ Secure configuration management
Monitoring & Logging:
✗ Structured logging implementation
✗ Performance metrics collection
✗ Health check endpoints
IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:

Architecture:
Consider implementing event-driven architecture for better scalability
Add middleware layer for cross-cutting concerns
Implement circuit breakers for external API calls
Performance:
Add connection pooling for database operations
Implement batch processing for transactions
Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
Testing:
Add comprehensive integration tests
Implement contract tests for external APIs
Add performance benchmarks
Operations:
Add health check endpoints
Implement proper metrics collection
Add automated backup system for SQLite database
Documentation:
Add API documentation
Include setup guide for new blockchain/bank integrations
Add troubleshooting guide
CRITICAL PRIORITIES:

Complete the background processing system as it's core to the application's purpose
Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
Add proper security measures for credential management
Complete the transaction processing pipeline
Add monitoring and logging capabilities
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific area or provide more detailed recommendations for implementation priorities?
