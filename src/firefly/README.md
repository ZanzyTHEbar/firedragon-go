# Firefly API Stubs

This directory is dedicated to generating a go-client for the `firefly-iii-6.2.8` OpenAPI 3.0 specification file.

This specification can be gound [here](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/firefly-iii-6.2.8-v1.yaml).

The root spec can be found here: https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org

I will do my best to keep this up to date with the latest version of the API.
